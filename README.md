# Free City Hacks
![Free City Hacks](files/img/icon-fch.jpg "icon-fch")

Building up from the team that organized and facilitated [HacktoberfestinAba](https://HacktoberfestinAba.github.io), **Free City Hacks** is a fast growing network of students and developers who come together to learn, collaborate, solve local problems using technology, and have fun in a very inclusive environment leveraging on the power of open source.

### Our Goal
Everything we do within the network is structured to help our members achieve the following experiences:
* explore new and exciting opportunities,
* build maintainable, world-class products and services,
* network with people from other fields of technology, and
* grow beyond our local environment.

## Focus
Our focus is on helping to close the digital divide by providing our members as well as other interested participants with regular updates on relevant technology trends through meetups and events where we inspire makers to build competitive and maintainable products using world-class technologies and globally accepted best practices.

### Our Activities
As a network, our primary aim of coming together is to study through active continuous learning by working independently or collaboratively through practical-based lab sessions using world-class learning resources crafted by and for the general maker network.

To achieve this, we are very delighted to be working with the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://raspberrypi.org) to run two coder programs, [Raspberry Jam](https://raspberrypi.org/jam) and [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com), to support our learning and development in becoming future-ready makers.

Our *Raspberry Jams* focus majorly on celebrating physical computing with the Raspberry Pi computer and other maker tools while our *CoderDojo* is modelled as a coding club to support the learning of young people from age 7 to 17. Through both programs, we aim to introduce young people to the art of programming and inspire them to build stunning projects using modern, engaging, open source tools like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [Python](https://python.org), [Linux](https://linuxfoundation.org) and other interesting projects.

Additionally, we are opportuned to partner with other international tech communities including [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io) to plan, organize, facilitate and/or participate in both local and international workshops and student hackathons, giving us the opportunity to express our creativity in a much more open, inclusive and collaboration-friendly environment.

## Cheese Burger
One striking beauty of our network is that we are working with a lean model that allows our team to be nimble enough to naturally embrace the new DevOps culture for faster collaboration and better tech experience.
