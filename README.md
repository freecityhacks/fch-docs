# Free City Hacks

![Free City Hacks](files/img/icon-fch.jpg "icon-fch")

Building up from the team that organized and facilitated [HacktoberfestinAba](https://HacktoberfestinAba.github.io), Free City Hacks is structured as a developer-focused platform that works to provide access to 'up-to-date' digital learning resources and support for the exploration and use of top-notch programming environments and magical maker kits, leveraging the power of open source, and celebrating the maker experience.

## Our Vision

Our vision is to inspire fun in the local making culture by promoting the hashtag: *#AfricanTechFun*.

## Our Mission

To achieve this, we've made it our core mission to find sustainable ways for local developers to connect with rapidly evolving tech trends and to provide the relevant assistance for young people to get acquainted with physical computing and digital making through practical-based, learning sessions and hands-on labs.

## The Hashtag

The hashtag *#AfricanTechFun* defines our platform's native approach towards improving the traditional artistry in Africa's evolving technological industry with due respect to our positively diversified, cultural heritage.

## Our Activities

On a simple note, we plan, organize, and facilitate tech meetups, workshops and festivals that promote community-driven education, peer-to-peer collaboration, as well as inspire the convenience for seamless networking among enthusiasts and professionals alike within the tech industry. All our events are, therefore, well planned and structured to be of high quality, rich in content and experienced within a fun, secure, and inclusive environment.

Forwording on the said vision, we are already working with the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://raspberrypi.org) to run two coder programs, [Raspberry Jam](https://raspberrypi.org/jam) and [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com), to support learning and development.

Through both programs, we aim to inspire and encourage young people to get involved in the field of computing where they are free to tinker with innovative programming tools, and build embedded interacting platforms *the African way*.
