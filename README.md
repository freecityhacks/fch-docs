# Free City Hacks
Free City Hacks is a volunteer-led network of tech enthusiasts, students and developers within and around Aba who come together to learn, collaborate, solve problems and have fun in a very inclusive environment supported by the [Raspberry Jam](https://raspberrypi.org/jam) family.

## Our Goal
Our focus is on helping our world achieve sustainability using a unique approach to closing the digital divide in the developing world. We aim to provide both new and veteran developers with regular updates on technology and encourage makers in every field to build competitive and maintainable products using globally recognized technologies and widely accepted best practices, a good way to contribute to achieving Sustainable Goal 9.

## Our Service
Leveraging on the power of active learning, we organize and facilitate in-house monthly jams (based on community needs) and host occasional hackathons geared towards helping participants continuously learn and improve their use of modern developer tools when building products and services.

As a network, we also help to prepare, organize and facilitate practical-based learning sessions that help new developers come up to speed with relevant technologies during conferences and festivals organized by and for the tech community.

## Cheese Burger!
To be very honest, we are stoked about fun-filled practical learning which is why we advocate for our members to also compete in various local and international hackathons, giving us the opportunity to network with people from other fields of technology and grow beyond our local environment.
