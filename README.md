# Free City Hacks
Free City Hacks is a volunteer-led network of tech enthusiasts, students and developers within and around Aba who come together to learn,collaborate, solve problems and have fun in a very inclusive environment supported by the [Raspberry Jam](https://raspberrypi.org/jam) family.

## Our Mission
Leveraging on the power of active learning, we work to organize and facilitate in-house monthly jams based on community needs and host occasional hackathons geared towards improving the experience in our tech ecosystem.

As a network, we also help to prepare, organize and facilitate practical-based learning sessions that help both new and veteran developers come up to speed with relevant technologies during conferences and festivals organized by the tech community.

To be very honest, we are stoked about fun-filled practical learning which is why we also advocate for our members to also compete in various local and international hackathons, giving us the opportunity to network with people from other fields of technology and grow beyond our local environment.

## 
Additionally, our unique approach to closing the digital divide in the developing world gears towards providing programmers with regular updates on technology and encouraging makers in every field to build competitive and maintainable products using globally recognized technologies and widely accepted best practices.
