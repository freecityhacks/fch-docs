# Free City Hacks
Free City Hacks is a volunteer-led network of tech enthusiasts, students and developers who come together to learn, collaborate, solve problems and have fun in a very inclusive environment leveraging the power of open source.

## Our Goal
Our focus is on helping to close the digital divide by providing our members as well as other interested participants with regular updates on relevant technology trends through meetups and events where we inspire makers to build competitive and maintainable products using world-class technologies and globally accepted best practices.

## Our Activities
As a network, our primary aim of coming together is to learn by working independently or collaboratively through practical-based lab sessions using world-class learning resources crafted by and for developers and makers.

To achieve this, we are very delighted to be work with the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://raspberrypi.org) to run two coder programs, [Raspberry Jam](https://raspberrypi.org/jam) and [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com), to support our learning and development as makers.

Our *Raspberry Jams* focuses on celebrating physical computing with the Raspberry Pi computer and other maker tools while our *CoderDojo* is modelled as a coding club for people aged 7 to 17 years. Through both programs, we aim to introduce young people to the art of programming and inspire them to build stunning projects using modern, engaging, open source tools like [Scratch](https://mit.edu/scratch), [Python](https://python.org), [Linux](https://linuxfoundation.org) and other interesting projects.

Additionally, we are opportuned to partner with many other international tech communities including [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io) to plan, organize, facilitate and/or participate in local and international workshops and student hackathons, giving us the opportunity to express our creativity in a much more open, inclusive and collaboration-friendly environment.
