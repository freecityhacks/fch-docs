# Free City Hacks

![Free City Hacks](files/img/icon-fch.png "icon-fch")

Building up from the team that organized and facilitated [HacktoberfestinAba](https://HacktoberfestinAba.github.io), we've structured *Free City Hacks* to operate as a developer-focused platform that works to provide access to 'up-to-date' digital learning resources and support for the exploration and use of top-notch programming environments and magical maker kits, leveraging the power of open source in celebrating our local maker culture.

## Our Vision

*#AfricanTechFun*
Developers hate stress. We want to keep it that way.

## Our Mission

To achieve this, we've made it our core mission to find sustainable ways for improving local developers' access to rapidly evolving tech trends and provide the required assistance for young people to get acquainted with physical computing and digital making through their regular participating in our inspiring, practical-based, learning sessions and hands-on labs, thereby supercharging the hashtag.

## The Hashtag

The hashtag [*#AfricanTechFun*](https://twitter.com/freecityhacks/status/1150831205690019840) defines our platform's native approach towards improving the traditional, inspirational artistry in Africa's rapidly evolving technological industry with due respect to our positively diversified, yet inclusive cultural heritage.

## Our Activities

On a simple note, we plan, organize, and facilitate tech meetups, workshops and festivals that promote community-driven education, peer-to-peer collaboration, as well as provide a convenient avenue for the seamless networking among enthusiasts and professionals alike within the tech industry. All our events are, therefore, well planned and structured to be of high quality, rich in content, experienced within a fun, secure, and inclusive environment, and branded with our signature hashtag *#AfricanTechFun*.

Forwarding on the said vision, we are already working with the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://raspberrypi.org) to run two coder programs, [Raspberry Jam](https://raspberrypi.org/jam) and [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com), to support learning and development.

Through both programs, we aim to inspire and encourage young people to get involved in the field of computing within an ecosystem where they find it easy to access and tinker with innovative programming tools to build aesthetically enhanced and interactive platforms *the African way*.
