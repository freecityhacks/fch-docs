## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the *README.md* with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment    variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the *README.md* to the new version that    this *Pull Request* would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [Git](http://git-scm.com/).
4. You may merge the *Pull Request* in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if     you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
