# **Community Code of Conduct**
Being a member of Free City Hacks gives you the opportunity to participate in a lot of innovative projects alongside other creative minds. As such, we have modelled this Community Code of Conduct to reflect the qualities we advocate for. We hereby do encourage everyone interested in playing a role with us, either as a full-time member or as a volunteer, to embody these best practices:

* Be respectful: We're all part of the same community, be friendly, welcoming, and generally nice. Every member of the Free City Hacks family is expected to be of most polite manner when interacting with others. Treat others how you want to be treated, be someone that other people want to be around. It’s all about “team effort”.

* Be considerate: All opinions matter, in some cases you would find yourself compromising and that is the team spirit. You are not a team because you work together, you are team because you trust, respect and care for each other.
 
* Participate. Join in on discussions, show up for in-person meetings regularly, offer feedback, and help implement that feedback.

* Have patience: You would be working with a lot of people who are unique in their own way, patience is a virtue that would go a long way for comfort.

* Collaborate: The best teamwork comes from people who are independently focused on achieving the same goal in harmony. You are not generally expected to complete tasks alone, reach out and get other team members interested and involved.

* Be constructive: Be positive in your communication to fellow members. Don't get into flamewars, make personal attacks, vent, or rant unconstructively. Everyone must take responsibility for the community and take the initiative to diffuse tension and discontinue any negative thread(s) as early as possible.

* Be responsive: If you have some form of responsibility in your community, be aware of your own constraints. If you know that a new job or personal situation will limit your time, find someone who can take over for you and transfer the relevant information (contacts, passwords, etc.) for a smooth transition. Step down responsibly.

* Licensing: Please adhere to licensing rules on any project you get to work on. When developing a project to be hosted under Free City Hacks, be careful to be as inclusive as possible in your decision making.

* Safety: At every Free City Hacks related event, weapons of any sort are prohibited and we discourage smoking on premises.
