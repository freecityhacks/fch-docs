## Enabling Reports

Free City Hacks will ensure that safe, appropriate, accessible means of reporting safeguarding concerns are made available to our members and the communities we work with.

Any person reporting concerns or complaints should endeavour to do so through our officially recommended email 

Free City Hacks will also accept complaints from external sources such as members of the public, partners and official bodies.

### How To Report A Safeguarding Concern

Members or participants who have a complaint or concern relating to safeguarding should report it immediately to the Programme Maintainer.  If the person does not feel comfortable reporting to the Maintainer (for example if they feel that the report will not be taken seriously, or if that person is implicated in the concern) they may report to any other appropriate personel. For example, this could be a member of the Advocate Team.

Please contact [freecityhacks@outlook.com](mailto://freecityhacks@outlook.com).

## Response

Free City Hacks will follow up safeguarding reports and concerns according to policy and procedure, and legal and statutory obligations (see Procedures for reporting and response to safeguarding concerns in Associated Policies).

Free City Hacks will apply appropriate disciplinary measures to staff found in breach of policy.

Free City Hacks will offer support to survivors of harm caused by staff or associated personnel, regardless of whether a formal internal response is carried out (such as an internal investigation). Decisions regarding support will be led by the survivor.

We are hoping to build a foundational model for inclusive learning, so we are open to partnerships with well known organizations like the [Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.org) to help in building a safe and convenient learning platform.

## Confidentiality

It is essential that confidentiality in maintained at all stages of the process when dealing with safeguarding concerns. Information relating to the concern and subsequent case management should be shared on a need to know basis only, and should be kept secure at all times.

## Glossary of Terms

### Beneficiary of Assistance

### Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA)

The term used by the humanitarian and development community to refer to the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of affected populations by staff or associated personnel.  The term derives from the United Nations Secretary General’s Bulletin on Special Measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (ST/SGB/2003/13)

### Safeguarding

Safeguarding can be defined as protecting peoples' health, wellbeing and human rights, and enabling them to live free from harm, abuse and neglect

In our sector, we understand it to mean protecting people, including children and at risk adults, from harm that arises from coming into contact with our staff or programmes.  One donor definition is as follows:
    Safeguarding means taking all reasonable steps to prevent harm, particularly sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment from occurring; to protect people, especially vulnerable adults and children, from that harm; and to respond appropriately when harm does occur.

This definition draws from our values and principles and shapes our culture. It pays specific attention to preventing and responding to harm from any potential, actual or attempted abuse of power, trust, or vulnerability, especially for sexual purposes.
Safeguarding applies consistently and without exception across our programmes, partners and staff. It requires proactively identifying, preventing and guarding against all risks of harm, exploitation and abuse and having mature, accountable and transparent systems for response, reporting and learning when risks materialise. Those systems must be survivor-centred and also protect those accused until proven guilty.
Safeguarding puts beneficiaries and affected persons at the centre of all we do.

### Sexual Abuse

The term ‘sexual abuse’ means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. 

### Sexual Exploitation

The term ‘sexual exploitation’ means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another.  This definition incudes human trafficking and modern slavery.

### Survivor

The person who has been abused or exploited. The term ‘survivor’ is often used in preference to ‘victim’ as it implies strength, resilience and the capacity to survive, however it is the individual’s choice how they wish to identify themselves.

### At Risk Adult

Sometimes also referred to as vulnerable adult. A person who is or may be in need of care by reason of mental or other disability, age or illness; and who is or may be unable to take care of him or herself, or unable to protect him or herself against significant harm or exploitation.
